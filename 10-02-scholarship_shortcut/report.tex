Billboards dataset from raw to tidy to EDA.
Data in its orginal form was in ``long'' format with a song on each row and a separate column
for the ranking from week 1 to week 72.
We ``tidied'' the data so it follows Hadley Wickham's tidy data principles.

Figure \ref{fig:avgrankbyweekacrossmonths} shows the average rating of songs
over the year with a different line drawn depending on which month the song was initially released.

Figure \ref{fig:coefspredictrankweeknointercept} shows the point estimate and 95\% confidence interval looking at the rank of a song in the year 2000 as the weeks go by.

In figure \ref{fig:coefspredictrankweekartistsorted} we see that Missy Elliott isn't doing so great.
Sad.
But this analysis is a bit nonsensical anyway.
